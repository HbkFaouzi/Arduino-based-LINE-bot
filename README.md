# Arduino-based-LINE-bot
This project aims to create a LINE bot that notifies you via the LINE messaging app when someone enters your house by infraction using an Arduino and PIR motion sensor.

## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

To create a low-cost, easy-to-replicate solution for home security monitoring
To provide a customizable notification system that allows homeowners to take action in the event of an infraction
To demonstrate the potential of integrating IoT devices with messaging apps for home automation and security purposes

The project requires the following components:

## Prerequisites
* LINE account
* LINE developer account
* Arduino Uno board
* PIR motion sensor
* Jumper wires
* USB cable

Here and example of Arduino with PIR motion sensor.

The PIR motion sensor detects motion within its range and sends a signal to the Arduino board. The Arduino board processes the signal and sends a notification message to the LINE.

To set up the project, you will need to connect the PIR motion sensor to the Arduino and use the program to handle the sensor data. You will also need to create a LINE bot account and configure it to receive notifications from the Arduino.

Once the setup is complete, the bot will send you a notification message whenever someone enters your house by infraction give you the time of the infraction and the eaving time, allowing you to take immediate action.

## Project Features
The key features of this project include:

Easy-to-follow setup instructions for hardware and software components
Integration with the LINE messaging app for easy notification delivery
Customizable notification messages to suit your needs
Low-cost components and easy-to-find parts for easy replication
